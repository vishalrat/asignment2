				<p>Two decades after lifting the World Cup on home soil, France is ready to relive the glory with one of the most talented teams they have had in recent memory. Kylian Mbappe, Ousmane Dembele, Presnel Kimpembe, are a few eye-catching names in recent years, and they are set to join superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at the World Cup in Russia, reports Xinhua news agency. The final edition of World Cup in the 20th century created indelible memories for France, when it came back from two consecutive absences from the tournament to stand on top of the world after beating Brazil 3-0 in the final. France entered their "Golden Era" courtesy midfield maestro Zinedine Zidane and lethal forward Thierry Henry, in a roster also featuring Didier Deschamps, Les Bleus' current head coach. </p>

			<P>That squad also included stars like Laurent Blanc, Emmannuel Petit, Robert Pires, Christian Dugarry, David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly and Patrick Vierra among others. Deschamps has valued the team discipline and spirit more than ever since he took over after the 2012 European Championship. The defensive midfielder didn't want a repeat of the World Cup eight years ago when players refused to train and France had to face an embarrassing early exit.

			Adrien Rabiot's removal from the standby list was the latest challenge that Deschamps has had faced in his tenure. The frustrated Paris Saint-Germain midfielder declined to be named in the 11-member standby list, which was described by Deschamps as a "huge mistake".</P>

			Deschamps also read a letter from injured center half Laurent Koscielny at a meeting, calling on national pride and team spirit from his team members. "It's a good idea and I've read the letter to players," said the 49-year-old.

			Under Deschamps' spell, France made into quarter-finals of the 	World Cup in Brazil, losing to eventual winners Germany. Two years later they fell short against Portugal in the 2016 Euro final.

			They can dream more this time, as a string of talents have emerged in recent years.

		<p>Manuel Neuer will be Germany's first-choice goalkeeper if he makes Joachim Low's World Cup squad, despite not having played since September.

		Bayern Munich's Neuer, 32, missed almost the entire season after breaking his foot and undergoing surgery.

		Head coach Low picked four goalkeepers in his 27-man preliminary squad, which he will cut to a final 23 on Monday.

		"Manuel will go to the World Cup as our number one," said Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff.

		"If he makes the squad then Marc-Andre [ter Stegen] will be number two.

		"Manuel is already full on track. He does not need to get back on it."

		Germany are in Group F with Mexico, Sweden and South Korea, and play their first match on Sunday, 17 June.
		The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.[5] Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings,[6] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.[7] During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and the UEFA nations were thus ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain

		<p>For Mikel John Obi, it was the boyhood dream that soured. “It was a disaster,” the Nigeria midfielder says of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil – his first involvement at a finals.

		From the outside looking in, there was a depressingly familiar undercurrent in the form of a pay dispute between the Nigeria Football Federation and the players. It led to a boycott of training from the latter days before the last-16 tie against France, which they lost 2-0. From the inside looking out, it was simply toxic.

		For the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations – the 209 FIFA member associations minus automatically qualified hosts Russia – entered the qualifying process.[15] Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches,[16][17] while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.[18] Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.

			Of the thirty-two nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, twenty countries competed at the previous edition of the tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[25] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments include: Egypt, returning to the finals after a 28-year absence from their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, returning after a 36-year absence (since 1982); and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It is the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) have qualified for the World Cup
